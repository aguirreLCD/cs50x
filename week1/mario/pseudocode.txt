1.Ask the user in the Prompt to type in a value for height;
2.If height is not a positive integer between 1 and 8 inclusive, or is not an integer at all: go back to step one;
3.Print the pyramid (lines with columns with spaces and hashes), and then a newline;

# Code:
- declare a variable for height;
- use the function get_int to ask for a input;
- to check if the input value is between 1 and 8 inclusive:
    - code a do-while loop (because we need to ask the user at least once to type in a height);
- then create a pyramid:
    - *create the row;
        - code a for loop to increment the number of lines;
        - print the column with hashes;
            - code a nested for loop to print hashes according to the number of lines;
        - print the column with spaces;
            - code another nested for loop to print spaces according to the number of lines;
        - print new line;
            - inside the for loop;
