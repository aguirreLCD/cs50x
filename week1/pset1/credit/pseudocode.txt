//Infos about credit cards
American Express: 15 digits, starts with 34 or 37;
MasterCard: 16 digits, starts with 51, 52, 53, 54 or 55;
Visa: 13 or 16 digits, starts with 4;
(every valid credit card number satisfies a checksum);

//what the checksum algorithm does
Multiply every other digit by 2, starting with the number’s second-to-last digit, and then add those products’ digits together.
Add the sum to the sum of the digits that weren’t multiplied by 2.
If the total’s last digit is 0 (or, put more formally, if the total modulo 10 is congruent to 0), the number is valid!

//Pseudocode:
1.Ask the user for a credit card number;
2.Reports (via printf) whether it is a valid American Express, MasterCard, or Visa card number,
per the definitions of each’s format herein;

# last line of output need to be: AMEX\n or MASTERCARD\n or VISA\n or INVALID\n;



## split the credit card number into digits

while(number > 0)
   variable = the number % 10
   divide the number by 10
   logic to print the variable's word, in here
end while loop
