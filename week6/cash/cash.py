# Implement a program that calculates the minimum number of coins required to give a user change;
# first asks the user how much change is owed and then spits out the minimum number of coins with which said change can be made;
# If the user fails to provide a non-negative value,
# your program should re-prompt the user for a valid amount again and again until the user complies.
# Incidentally, so that we can automate some tests of your code,
# we ask that your programâ€™s last line of output be only the minimum number of coins possible: an integer followed by a newline.
