Check that program was run with one command-line argument
    if (argc == 2);

Iterate over the provided argument to make sure all characters are digits
    (isdigit());

Convert that command-line argument from a string to an int
    (atoi());

Prompt user for plaintext
    (get_string);

Iterate over each character of the plaintext:
    (for (int i = 0, n = strlen(s); i < n; i++));

           (isalpha() -> isupper() || islower());

        If it is an uppercase letter, rotate it, preserving case, then print out the rotated character

        If it is a lowercase letter, rotate it, preserving case, then print out the rotated character

        If it is neither, print out the character as is

Print a newline
    printf("\n");
    return 0;
