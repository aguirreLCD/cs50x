Write a program called readability that takes a text and determines its reading level;

1. Prompt the user for a string of text (using get_string), and prints it back out;

2. Count the number of letters;

3. Count the number of words;

4. Count the number of sentences;

5. Print as output "Grade X" where X is the grade level computed by the Coleman-Liau formula, rounded to the nearest integer.

    5.1 If the resulting index number is 16 or higher,
    output "Grade 16+" instead of giving the exact index number.

    5.2 If the index number is less than 1, output "Before Grade 1".
